# How To Start Wireframing A Data Dashboard

Four techniques to start a wireframe project from scratch and ensure that you dedicate enough time to the ideation phase, where the success of your dashboard begins.

The most common mistake people make with wireframes is rushing through them. Spending time in the ideation phase is where wireframing delivers the most ROI. It's where user/audience/stakeholder goals and workflows are synthesized into a plan for moving from the problem space to the solution space.

An empty wireframe can be intimidating. You want the end result, a wireframe that takes the idea in your head and makes it real. And you know that at a certain point you'll get into "the zone" where the friction disappears and designing feels almost effortless.

But now it's still a blank page.

So, how do you go from nothing to something?

Here are a few tried-and-true methods with real examples that we use to kick start our wireframing.

# Four techniques for starting a wireframe

* Start with words instead of pictures
* Create a site map
* Use the existing design
* Find inspiration elsewhere

## 1. Start with words instead of pictures

If you're having troubling imagining what it should look like, it probably means that you haven't answered some important questions. Instead of diving straight into the user interface, we often start by answering some basic questions that apply to any project. This is sometimes called a Brief.

## Questions to ask before wireframing

* Who will be using it? (i.e., the audience)
* What is their goal? What problem does this dashboard answer or ability does it enable for them?
* What are some of the data actions or operations they are likely to perform? (i.e., the workflows)

> ## Note: 
> If you have a hard time answering these questions, you're probably not ready to start wireframing. In this case, we suggest that you go back to the gathering requirements phase.

Even if you are wireframing alone, it's useful to go through the step of explicitly writing down this information about your project. It will help you get back on track when you get stuck and will be a huge help to anyone looking at your wireframes later.

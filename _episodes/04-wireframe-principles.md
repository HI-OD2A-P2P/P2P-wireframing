# Three Key Principle For Data Dashboard Wireframing

There are three key principles to ensure that your wireframe is good and useful for all stakeholders.

## Clarity: 

Your wireframe needs to answer the questions of what the dashboard will provide for users. The wireframe should be an aid for the developers to visualize the dashboard layout and ensure that the userâ€™s most important questions are answered and goals are achievable without being distracted by more aesthetic considerations.

## Confidence: 

Ease of navigation and access to important insights in the dashboard can increase user confidence in the message being conveyed. Aesthetic elements like buttons or boxes in unexpected places cause confusion and overall dissatisfaction. Details like this can be organized and addressed at the wireframing stage by using familiar navigational processes and intuitive positioning for insights.

## Simplicity: 

Too much information, text, and colors can be distracting and take away from the main message conveyed by the dashboard. Avoid being bogged down by considerations of colors and other aesthetic elements at the wireframing stage. Attractiveness at this stage is not a consideration.

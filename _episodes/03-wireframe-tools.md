# Wireframing Tools

The best part about wireframing is that you can do it on paper with a pen. Many business users also use spreadsheets—merging cells and drawing boxes—to create low-fidelity wireframes. Designers also use visual design tools such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator to get the work done. However, none of these tools were made for wireframing and have their limitations. For instance, you might not be able to move features around on a spreadsheet. Or replicate sections automatically.

It’s for reasons of convenience and efficiency that professional UX designers use wireframing tools. Some of the most popular ones are:

### Lucidcharts: 

A online chart and diagram platform with Lucidchart, you can also build both wireframes and mockups. A free version is available.

### Adobe XD: 

A newer app on the block, Adobe XD is perfect for designers who are comfortable with the Adobe Suite of products such as Photoshop or Illustrator. It offers a simple and fast interface, pre-built elements, tools for object groups, etc. It is available for Mac and Windows.

### Balsamiq: 

A web-based app with a simple interface, Balsamiq is an exclusive wireframing tool. It comes pre-built with icons and features, reusable symbols, offers drag-and-drop of elements, and prides itself on speed. It’s also available as Windows and Mac desktop apps.

### Sketch: 

A digital design platform, Sketch is an end-to-end design tool. It allows you to create your own toolkit to design wireframes quickly. It also has a large community of users contributing to the tool’s knowledge base. However, Sketch is a paid app available for the Mac environment only.

Several other tools such as Invision Studio, UXPin, Moqups, etc., offer a wide range of functionalities. You can also try some of the best wireframe tools for free before you pick the right one for yourself.

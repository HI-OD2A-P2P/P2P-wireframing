# Wireframing Tools

The best part about wireframing is that you can do it on paper with a pen. Many business users also use spreadsheets—merging cells and drawing boxes—to create low-fidelity wireframes. Designers also use visual design tools such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator to get the work done. However, none of these tools were made for wireframing and have their limitations. For instance, you might not be able to move features around on a spreadsheet. Or replicate sections automatically.

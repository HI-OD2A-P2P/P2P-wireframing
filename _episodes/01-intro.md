# Introduction

Wireframing is often the most challenging yet overlooked phase of a dashboard building project. 

The wireframe captures what graphs and visual displays will be part of the dashboard and how they will be arranged. 

These wireframes are not fully functional but a representation of the functionality that the dashboard will eventually contain.

## Benfits of nuilding a wireframe before a dashboard:

### Prioritize most important data: 

Wireframing helps clearly understand the goals of the dashboard and prioritize the most important to display.

### Ensures your stakeholders are happy with the final product: 

Wireframes help convey the visual feel and structure of the dashboard before spending enormous time and resources on developing the dashboard. Stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and make sure that the dashboard will answer critical questions and offer insights before moving to the development phase.

### Means of Communication: 

A wireframe helps avoid miscommunication and expensive changes to dashboards after development. Wireframes offer a visual language for designers to convey their ideas and vision for the dashboard for effective communication and visualization. Visual language has the benefit of conveying depth of space, direction, and contrast, which help the viewers make connection and relationship between elements more intuitively. More intricate wireframes can also simulate interactions between elements thereby creating more intuitive representations of the dashboard. Armed with a thorough understanding of the dashboard, all members of the management and development team will be able to raise concerns and collaboratively improve the dashboard.

### Transfer charts onto the final dashboard: 

Having a wireframe that has gone through the iterative process of refinement and approval by all team members makes it relatively straightforward for developers to build the dashboard. The chances of miscommunication and ambiguity in building the desired dashboard are low since the wireframe conveys the dashboard elements and placement clearly.

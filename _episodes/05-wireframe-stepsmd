# How To Start Wireframing A Data Dashboard

Four techniques to start a wireframe project from scratch and ensure that you dedicate enough time to the ideation phase, where the success of your dashboard begins.

The most common mistake people make with wireframes is rushing through them. Spending time in the ideation phase is where wireframing delivers the most ROI. It's where user/audience/stakeholder goals and workflows are synthesized into a plan for moving from the problem space to the solution space.

An empty wireframe can be intimidating. You want the end result, a wireframe that takes the idea in your head and makes it real. And you know that at a certain point you'll get into "the zone" where the friction disappears and designing feels almost effortless.

But now it's still a blank page.

So, how do you go from nothing to something?

Here are a few tried-and-true methods with real examples that we use to kick start our wireframing.

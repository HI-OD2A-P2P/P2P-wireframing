# Wireframing for Data Dashboards

### Summary

This webinar will introduce wireframing for dashboards. Wireframing is often the most challenging yet overlooked phase of a dashboard building project. A wireframe is a visual layout of your dashboard. The wireframe captures what graphs and visual displays will be part of the dashboard and how they will be arranged. These wireframes are not fully functional but a representation of the functionality that the dashboard will eventually contain.
